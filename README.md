### Hi, I am Mechoj08 
I'm Jochem Hoogendijk and I'm in my last year of  Mathematics @ Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, specializing in Mathematical analysis/Mathematical physics.
- Currently working on: Master thesis on coercivity conditions in stochastic partial differential equations.
- Currently learning: General PDE theory, some harmonic analysis, C++ programming and other computer science stuff.
- Looking for tips about: Mathematical writing, Structuring big software engineering projects.

If you've got any interesting papers for me to read, podcasts to listen to or books to read, don't hesitate to email me! I love to learn about new things I've never heard about.
