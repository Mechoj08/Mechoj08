### Hi, I am Mechoj08
I'm in my last year of Mathematics @Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, specializing in Mathematical analysis/Mathematical physics.
- Currently working on: Startup in NLP
- Currently learning: Lie groups (math), Transformers (Comp. Sci./NLP) and Biophysics (physics)
- Looking for tips about: Preparing to build projects, set-up phase

If you've got any interesting papers for me to read, podcasts to listen to or books to read, don't hesitate to email me! I love to learn about new things I've never heard about.
